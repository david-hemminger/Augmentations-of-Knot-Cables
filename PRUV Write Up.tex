\section{Introduction}
\todo[color=\ltblue,inline]{introduce corollary for iterated cables}
Let $K$ be a knot in $S^3$.  The \emph{meridional rank} of $K$, written $\mr(K)$, is the minimal size of a meridional generating set of the knot group of $K$.  It is bounded above by the bridge number $b(K)$, and Problem 1.11 of \cite{Kir95} asks whether $\mr(K) = b(K)$ for all knots $K$.  Cornwell has proven that the \emph{augmentation rank} $\ar(K)$ of $K$ (which is defined in Section \ref{SecBG}) bounds the meridional rank from below, and that $\ar(K) = \mr(K) = b(K)$ for some families of knots, including torus knots \cite{Cor13b}.


%Define ar
%generated by entries of $A_{ij}$

The main result of this paper is that if $\ar(K) = b(K)$ and $K$ is the closure of a braid with even writhe and index equal to $b(K)$, then the augmentation rank and bridge number are equal for any $(p,q)$-cable of $K$ where $\gcd(p,q) = 1$ and $p<q$.





\section{Background}
\label{SecBG}

  We review in Section \ref{SecBG_KCHdef} the construction of $HC_0(K)$ from the viewpoint of the combinatorial knot DGA, which was first defined in \cite{Ng08}; our conventions are those given in \cite{Ng12}. In Section \ref{SecBG_AugRk} we discuss augmentations in knot contact homology and their rank, which gives a bound on the meridional rank of the knot group useful for studying the relation between meridional rank and bridge number. Finally, in Section \ref{SecBG_AugExist} is a discussion of techniques from \cite{Cor13a} that we use to calculate the augmentation rank.

  Throughout the paper we denote by $B_n$ the $n$-strand braid group. We orient braids from left to right and label the strands $1,\ldots, n$, with 1 the topmost to $n$ the bottommost strand. We work with the generating set $\{\sigma_i^{\pm}$, $i=1,\ldots,n\}$ of $B_n$, where $\s_i$ has strands $i$ and $i+1$ that cross once in the manner depicted in Figure \ref{fig:BraidGens}.

    As usual, a braid may be closed to a link as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:BClosure}. The \emph{writhe} (or algebraic sum) of a braid $B\in B_n$, denoted $\omega(B)$, is the sum of the exponents in a factorization of $B$ in terms of the generators.

\subsection{Knot contact homology}
\label{SecBG_KCHdef}

  Here we cover the necessary preliminaries for defining the combinatorial knot DGA of Ng. This DGA was defined in order to be a calculation of knot contact homology and was shown to be so in \cite{EENS12} (see \cite{Ng12} for more details). Let $\A_n$ be the noncommutative unital algebra over $\Z$ freely generated by $a_{ij}$, $1\le i\ne j\le n$.  We define a homomorphism $\phi : B_n \rightarrow\Aut \A_n$ by defining it on the generators of $B_n$:

  \begin{equation}
  \phi_{\s_k}\colon
  \left\{
       \begin{array}{lr}
         a_{ij}\mapsto a_{ij} & i,j\ne k,k+1\\
         a_{k+1,i}\mapsto a_{ki} & i\ne k,k+1\\
         a_{i,k+1}\mapsto a_{ik} & i\ne k,k+1\\
         a_{k,k+1}\mapsto -a_{k+1,k} & \\
         a_{k+1,k}\mapsto -a_{k,k+1} & \\
         a_{ki}\mapsto a_{k+1,i} - a_{k+1,k}a_{ki} & i\ne k,k+1\\
         a_{ik}\mapsto a_{i,k+1} - a_{ik}a_{k,k+1} & i\ne k,k+1\\
       \end{array}
  \right.
  \label{DefnPhiMap}
  \end{equation}

  Let $\iota\colon B_n \rightarrow B_{n+1}$ be the inclusion $\s_i\mapsto\s_i$ so that strand $(n+1)$ does not interact with those from $B\in B_n$, and define $\phi_B^*\in \Aut \A_{n+1}$ by $\phi_B^* = \phi_B\circ\iota$.  We then define the $n\times n$ matrices $\Phi_B^L$ and $\Phi_B^R$ with entries in $\A_n$ by

  $$\phi_B^*(a_{i,n+1}) = \sum_{j=1}^n(\Phi_B^L)_{ij}a_{j,n+1}$$

  $$\phi_B^*(a_{n+1,i}) = \sum_{j=1}^na_{n+1,j}(\Phi_B^R)_{ji}$$

  Letting $\omega(B)$ be the writhe of $B$, define matrices $\bf{A}$ and $\bf{\Lambda}$ by

  \begin{equation}
  \bf{A}_{ij} = 
  \left\{
       \begin{array}{lr}
        a_{ij} & i<j\\
        -\mu a_{ij} & i>j\\
        1-\mu & i = j\\
       \end{array}
  \right.
  \label{def:Amatrix}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  \bf{\Lambda} = \diag[\lambda\mu^{\omega(B)},1,\ldots,1].
  \label{defn:Lambda}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{definition}
  Suppose that $K$ is the closure of $B\in B_n$ and let $R_0$ be the Laurent polynomial ring $\Z[\lambda^{\pm 1},\mu^{\pm 1}]$. Define $\mathcal{I}\subset \A_n\otimes R_0$ to be the ideal generated by the entries of $\bf{A} - \Lambda\cdot\Phi_B^L\cdot \bf{A}$ and $\bf{A} - \bf{A}\cdot\Phi_B^R\cdot\Lambda^{-1}$.  The \emph{degree zero homology of the combinatorial knot DGA} is $\operatorname{HC}_0(K) = (\A_n\otimes R_0)/\mathcal{I}$.
  \label{defn:HC_0}
  \end{definition}
  
  It was shown in \cite{Ng08} that the isomorphism class of $HC_0(K)$ is unchanged under conjugation and by positive and negative stabilization of $B$, hence $HC_0(K)$ is an invariant of the knot $K$ by Markov's theorem. We only consider $HC_0(K)$ here, but there is a larger invariant, the differential graded algebra discussed in \cite{Ng12}, where the image of the differential may be generated by the same elements as $\mathcal I$.

  The proofs in Section \ref{SecMain} require a number of computations of $\phi_B(a_{ij})$ for particular braids $B\in B_n$. Such computations are greatly benefited by an alternate description of the map $\phi_B$, which follows, that we will use liberally.

  Let $D$ be a flat disk, to the right of $B$, with $n$ points (punctures) where it intersects $K=\widehat{B}$ (see Figure \ref{FigA_nGens}). We assume the $n$ punctures of $D$ to be collinear, on a line that separates $D$ into upper and lower half-disks. Denote by $c_{ij}$ the isotopy class (fixing endpoints) of a path that is contained in the upper half-disk of $D$, with initial endpoint on the $i^{th}$ strand and terminal endpoint on the $j^{th}$ strand.

\end{figure}

  Considering $B$ as a mapping class element of the punctured disk, let $B\cdot c_{ij}$ denote the isotopy class of the path to which $c_{ij}$ is sent. Viewing $D$ from the left (as pictured), $\s_k$ acts by rotating the $k\textrm{-}$ and $(k+1)\textrm{-}$punctures an angle of $\pi$ about their midpoint in counter-clockwise fashion. Consider the \emph{algebra of paths} over $\Z$ generated by isotopy classes of paths in $D$ with endpoints on punctures, modulo the relation in Figure \ref{FigRelnPathAlg} (paths depicted there are understood to agree outside the neighborhood of the puncture shown). Let $F(c_{ij})=a_{ij}$ if $i<j$, and $F(c_{ij})=-a_{ij}$ if $i>j$. This was shown in \cite{Ng05} to define an algebra map to $\cl A_n$ satisfying $F(B\cdot c_{ij}) = \phi_B(F(c_{ij}))$.

  Let $\text{perm}:B_n\to S_n$ denote the homomorphism from $B_n$ to the symmetric group sending $\s_k$ to the transposition interchanging $k, k+1$. We will make use of the following property of $\phi_B$.

  \begin{lem} For some $B\in B_n$ and $1\le i\ne j\le n$, consider the element $\phi_B(a_{ij})\in \A_n$ as a polynomial expression in the (non-commuting) variables $\{a_{ij}, 1\le i\ne j\le n\}$. Writing $i'=\text{perm}(B)(i)$ and $j' = \text{perm}(B)(j)$, every non-constant monomial in $\phi_B(a_{ij})$ is a constant times $\prod_{k=0}^{l-1} a_{i_k,i_{k+1}}$, where $l\ge 1$ and $i_0=i'$, $i_l=j'$, and $i_k\ne i_{k+1}$ for each $0\le k\le l-1$.
  \label{lem:monomial}
  \end{lem}
  \begin{proof}Suppose a path $c$ in $D$ starts at puncture $p$ and ends at puncture $q$. The relation in Figure \ref{FigRelnPathAlg} equates $c$ with a sum (or difference) of another path with the same endpoints and a product of two paths, one beginning at $p$ and the other ending at $q$. A finite number of applications of this relation allows one to express $c$ as a polynomial in the $c_{pq},1\le p\ne q\le n$. The result follows since the class $B\cdot c_{ij}$ is represented by a path with endpoints the $i'$ and $j'$ punctures.

  Alternatively, the statement follows from noting that (\ref{DefnPhiMap}) defining $\phi_{\s_k}$ has the desired property and that $\phi:B_n\to\text{Aut}(\A_n)$ is a homomorphism.
  \end{proof}

\subsection{Augmentations and augmentation rank}
\label{SecBG_AugRk}

  Let $S$ be a ring with 1, and consider it a differential graded algebra supported in grading 0, with trivial differential. Augmentations of $(\A,\partial)$ are DGA maps $(\A,\partial)\to (S,0)$. For our setting, if $B\in B_n$ is a braid representative of $K$, such a map corresponds precisely to a homomorphism $\epsilon:\A_n\otimes R_0\to\C$ such that $\epsilon$ sends each generator (mentioned in \ref{defn:HC_0}) of $\mathcal I$ to zero.

  \begin{definition}
  Suppose that $K$ is the closure of $B\in B_n$. An \emph{augmentation} of $K$ is a homomorphism $\epsilon: \A_n\otimes R_0\rightarrow \C$ such that each element of $\mathcal I$ is sent by $\epsilon$ to zero.
  \label{defn:Aug}
  \end{definition}

  A correspondence between augmentations and particular representations of the knot group of $K$ were studied in \cite{Cor13a}. Let $\pi_K$ be the fundamental group of the complement of $K\subset S^3$. An element $g\in\pi_K$ is called a \emph{meridian} if it may be represented by the boundary of an embedded disk in $S^3$ that intersects $K$ in exactly one point. Recall that $\pi_K$ is generated by meridians. We may fix a meridian $m$ and generate $\pi_K$ by conjugates of $m$.

  \begin{definition}
  For any integer $r\ge1$, a homomorphism $\rho:\pi_K\to\text{GL}_r\C$ is a \emph{KCH representation} if there is a meridian $m$ of $K$ such that $\rho(m)$ is diagonalizable and has eigenvalue 1 with multiplicity $r-1$. We call $\rho$ a \emph{KCH irrep} if it is irreducible.
  \label{defn:KCHReps}
  \end{definition}

  In \cite{Ng08}, Ng describes an isomorphism between $HC_0(K)$ and an algebra constructed from elements of $\pi_K$. As discussed in \cite{Ng12}a KCH representation $\rho:\pi_K\to\text{GL}_r\C$ induces an augmentation $\epsilon_\rho$ of $K$. Given an augementation, the first author showed how to construct a KCH representation that induces it. In fact, we have the following rephrasing of results from \cite{Cor13a}.

  \begin{thm}[\cite{Cor13a}]
  Let $\epsilon:\A_n\otimes R_0\to\C$ be an augmentation with $\epsilon(\mu)\ne 1$. There is a KCH irrep $\rho:\pi_K\to\text{GL}_r\C$ such that $\epsilon_\rho=\epsilon$. Furthermore, for any KCH irrep $\rho:\pi_K\to\text{GL}_r\C$ such that $\epsilon_\rho = \epsilon$, $r$ equals the rank of $\epsilon({\bf A})$.
  \label{thm:AugKCH_Corresp}
  \end{thm}

  Considering Theorem \ref{thm:AugKCH_Corresp} we make the following definition.

  \begin{definition}
  The \emph{rank} of an augmentation $\epsilon:\A_n\otimes R_0\to\C$ with $\epsilon(\mu)\ne 1$ is the rank of $\epsilon({\bf A})$. Given a knot $K$, the \emph{augmentation rank of } $K$, denoted $\text{ar}(K)$, is the maximum rank among augmentations of $K$.
  \label{defn:AugRk}
  \end{definition}

  \begin{rem} The augmentation rank can be defined for target rings other than $\C$, but this paper only considers augmentations as in \ref{defn:Aug}.
  \end{rem}

  It is the case that $\text{ar}(K)$ is well-defined. That is, given $K$ there is a bound on the maximal rank of an augmentation of $K$.

  \begin{thm}[\cite{Cor13b}] Given a knot $K\subset S^3$, if $g_1,\ldots,g_d$ are meridians that generate $\pi_K$ and $\rho:\pi_K\to\text{GL}_r\C$ is a KCH irrep then $r\le d$.
  \label{thm:DimBound}
  \end{thm}

  As in the introduction, if we denote the meridional rank of $\pi_K$ by $\text{mr}(K)$, then Theorem \ref{thm:DimBound} implies that $\text{ar}(K)\le\text{mr}(K)$. In addition, the geometric quantity $b(K)$ called the bridge index of $K$ is never less than $\text{mr}(K)$. Thus we have the inequality \todo[color=yellow]{make it a corollary to refer to later}
    \[\text{ar}(K)\le\text{mr}(K)\le b(K).\]
  As a result, to verify for $K$ that $\text{mr}(K)=b(K)$ it suffices to find an augmentation of $K$ with rank equal to $b(K)$. As we discuss in the next section, we will concern ourselves in this paper with a setting where $\text{ar}(K)=n$ and there is a braid $B\in B_n$ which closes to $K$. This is a special situation, since $b(K)$ is strictly less than the braid index for many knots.

\subsection{Finding augmentations}
\label{SecBG_AugExist}
  The following theorem concerns the behavior of the matrices $\Phi_B^L$ and $\Phi_B^R$ under the product in $B_n$. It is an essential tool for studying $HC_0(K)$ and will be central to our arguments.

  \begin{thm}[\cite{Ng05}, Chain Rule] Let $B,B'$ be braids in $B_n$. Then $\Phi_{BB'}^L = \phi_B(\Phi_{B'}^L)\cdot\Phi_B^L$ and $\Phi_{BB'}^R = \Phi_B^R\cdot\phi_B(\Phi_{B'}^R)$.
  \label{thm:ChainRule}
  \end{thm}

  The main result of this paper concerns augmentations with rank equal to the braid index of the knot $K$. Suppose that $K$ is the closure of $B\in B_n$ and define the diagonal matrix $\Delta(B)=\text{diag}[(-1)^{w(B)},1,\ldots,1]$. The following statement follows from results in \cite[Section 5]{Cor13b}.

  \begin{thm}[\cite{Cor13a}] If $K$ is the closure of $B\in B_n$ and has a rank $n$ augmentation $\epsilon:\A_n\otimes R_0\to\C$, then 
    \begin{equation}
    \epsilon(\Phi_B^L)=\Delta(B)=\epsilon(\Phi_B^R).
    \label{eqn:FindingAugs}
    \end{equation}
    Furthermore, any homomorphism $\epsilon:\A_n\to\C$ which satisfies (\ref{eqn:FindingAugs}) can be extended to $\A_n\otimes R_0$ to produce a rank $n$ augmentation of $K$. 
  \label{thm:RanknAugs}
  \end{thm}

  Our proof of Theorem \ref{main} relies on this characterization of rank $n$ augmentations. Suppose the knot $K$ is the closure of $B\in B_k$ and has a rank $k$ augmentation $\epsilon_k$. In Section \ref{SecMain} we consider $B'\in B_p$ which has closure admitting a rank $p$ augmentation $\epsilon_p$. Applying the braid satellite construction to $B, B'$ \todo[color=\ltblue]{described in the introduction...} we obtain a satellite of $K$. We prove the theorem in Section \ref{SecMain} by describing a map from $\epsilon_k$ and $\epsilon_p$ that satisfies (\ref{eqn:FindingAugs}) for the braid satellite. By Theorem \ref{eqn:FindingAugs} this determines the desired rank $pk$ augmentation.

  There is a symmetry on the matrices $\Phi_B^L$ and $\Phi_B^R$ that is relevant to the study of augmentations in this setting. Define an involution $x\mapsto\overline x$ on $\A_n$ (termed \emph{conjugation}) as follows: first set $\overline{a_{ij}}=a_{ji}$; then, for any $x,y\in\A_n$, define $\overline{xy}=\overline y\hspace*{1pt}\overline x$ and extend the operation linearly to $\A_n$. We have the following symmetry.

  \begin{thm}[\cite{Ng05}, Prop.\hspace*{-0.7pt} 6.2]For a matrix of elements in $\A_n$, let $\overline{M}$ be the matrix such that $\left(\overline M\right)_{ij} = \overline{M_{ij}}$. Then for $B\in B_n$, $\Phi_B^R$ is the transpose of $\overline{\Phi_B^L}$.
  \label{thm:Transpose}
  \end{thm}

  %Define $\A_n^{ab}$ to be the quotient of $\A_n$ by the ideal generated by $\{xy-yx | x,y\in\A_n\}\cup\{a_{ij}-a_{ji} | i\ne j\}$. Any homomorphism $\epsilon:\A_n\to\C$ such that $\epsilon(a_{ij}-a_{ji})=0$ for all $i\ne j$ determines a homomorphism $\epsilon:\A_n^{ab}\to\C$. As a consequence, Theorems \ref{thm:RanknAugs} and \ref{thm:Transpose} imply that finding $\epsilon:\A_n\to\C$ such that $\epsilon(a_{ij}-a_{ji})=0$ and satisfying $\epsilon(\Phi_B^L) = \Delta(B)$ suffices to determine a rank $n$ augmentation. There do exist braids $B\in B_n$ and homomorphisms $\epsilon:\A_n\to\C$ satisfying (\ref{eqn:FindingAugs}), such that $\epsilon$ does not descend to $\A_n^{ab}$. However, to date every such braid $B\in B_n$ that has been found, also admits a homomorphism satisfying (\ref{eqn:FindingAugs}) that does descend to $\A_n^{ab}$.

$$B^{(p)} = \Sp_{n_1}\Sp_{n_2}\cdots\Sp_{n_m}$$

\noindent We then have the following result.

\begin{thm}\label{main}
Let $B\in B_k$, and let $B'\in B_{pk}$ be a braid in $B_p$ included into $B_{pk}$ such that the first $p$ strands of $B'$ close to a knot.  Suppose that there exists an augmentation $\epsilon_k\colon \A_k \rightarrow \C$ such that $\epsilon_k\left(\Phi_B^L\right) = \epsilon_k\left(\Phi_B^R\right) = \Delta(B)$ and an augmentation $\epsilon_p\colon \A_p \rightarrow \C$ such that $\epsilon_p\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right) = \epsilon_p\left(\Phi_{B'}^R\right) = \Delta(B')$.  Then there exists an augmentation $\epsilon\colon \A_{pk}\rightarrow \C$ such that $\epsilon\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}B'}^L\right) = \epsilon\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}B'}^R\right) = \Delta(B^{(p)}B')$.
\end{thm}



Among other things, this theorem implies that iterated cables of torus knots have meridional rank equal to their bridge number.  \todo[color=\ltblue]{braid rep've info needed to make well-defined} Consider a $(r,s)$-torus knot $T$ with $\gcd(r,s) = 1$ and $r<s$. $T$ has bridge number $r$ and is the closure of a braid $B$ on $r$ strands, and since all torus knots have bridge number equal to their augmentation rank (\todo[color=\ltblue]{cite cornwell}), we have that there exists an augmentation $\epsilon_T\colon \A_r\rightarrow \C$\todo[color=\ltblue]{finish this}. .  given by the braid sum of $T^{(p)}$ with a braid who's first $p$ strands form a torus knot with bridge number (and therefore augmentation rank) equal to $p$ and such that $w(T)$ is even (i.e. a $(p,q)$ torus knot, where $\gcd(p,q) = 1$, $p<q$, and $pq-q$ is even).  Theorem \ref{main} then says that this cable has augmentation rank equal to its braid index, implying that its meridional rank is equal to its bridge number.  Furthermore, we can iterate this process, taking cables of the resulting knots with augmentation rank, bridge number, and braid index all equal.\todo[color=\ltblue]{prob from Kirby list should be mentioned here}

Fix $p>0$ and let $B$ be a braid on $k$ strands. For each $1\le i\le pk$ define integers $q_i,r_i$ such that $i = q_ip + r_i$, where $0<r_i \le p$. Instrumental to the proof of Theorem \ref{main} will be the map $\psi\colon \A_{pk} \rightarrow \A_k\otimes \A_p$, defined as follows

$$
\psi(a_{ij}) =
\left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       1\otimes a_{r_ir_j} & \colon q_i = q_j\\
       a_{q_i+1,q_j+1}\otimes 1 & \colon r_i = r_j\\
       0 & \colon (q_i-q_j)(r_i-r_j)<0\\
       a_{q_i+1,q_j+1}\otimes a_{r_ir_j} & \colon (q_i-q_j)(r_i-r_j)>0\\
     \end{array}
\right.
$$

\noindent Note that $\psi(a_{ij}) \in 1\otimes \A_p$ or $\psi(a_{ij}) = 0$ if and only if $q_i = q_j$, and that $\psi(\overline{a_{ij}}) = \overline{\psi(a_{ij})}$.  This homomorphism gives us a way of relating $\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^L$ to $\Phi_B^L$ via the following proposition.


\begin{prop}\label{psiofbp}
For any braid $B$, $\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^L\right) = \left(\left(\Phi_B^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p$ and $\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^R\right) = \left(\left(\Phi_B^R\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p$\todo[color=\ltblue]{make consistent throughout paper}
\end{prop}


Note that here we mean the tensor product of $\Phi_B^L$ and $I_p$ as matrices, not as linear maps, while the tensor product of $\left(\Phi_B^L\otimes I_p\right)_{ij}$ and $1$ is a tensor product of algebra elements, so that if we divide the matrix $\psi(\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^L$ into $k^2$ $p\times p$ blocks, the $ij$th block is $\left(\Phi_B^L\right)_{ij}I_p$.

It turns out that instead of $\psi$ we could have defined a simpler homomorphism $\rho\colon \A_{pk}\rightarrow \A_k$ that would take $a_{ij}$ to $a_{q_{i+1},q_{j+1}}$ if $r_i=r_j$ and 0 otherwise, and Proposition \ref{psiofbp} would still be true (this follows from the same ideas used in the proof of Proposition \ref{psiofbp}).  The advantage of $\psi$ is that it doesn't send $a_{ij}$ to 0 if $q_i=q_j$, a fact which will be important in the proof of Theorem \ref{main}.


\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{main}]
Let $\delta\colon\A_p\rightarrow \C$ be a homomorphism, let $\pi\colon \C\otimes \C \rightarrow \C$ be a homomorphism defined by $\pi(a\otimes b) = ab$, and set $\epsilon = \pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\circ\psi$.  We will later break the theorem up into three cases depending on the parity of $w(B)$ and $p$ and in each case define $\delta$ such that $\delta(a_{ij})$ is one of $\pm \epsilon_p(a_{ij})$ in such a way that $\epsilon$ is an augmentation of $B^{(p)}B'$.  The Chain Rule theorem gives that
\begin{equation}
\pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\circ\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}B'}^L\right) = \pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\psi\left(\phi_{B^{(p)}}\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)\right)\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^L\right)
\label{eqn1MainPf}
\end{equation}

Note that since the non zero or one entries of $\Phi_{B'}^L$ are products of $a_{ij}$ where $i<j \le p$, $\phi_{B^{(p)}}$ takes each of the $a_{ij}$'s in these products to $a_{i + mp, j+mp}$ for some $0\le m<k$.  We have that $\psi$ takes $a_{i + mp, j+mp}$ to $1\otimes a_{ij}$, however, so

$$\psi\left(\phi_{B^{(p)}}\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)\right) = \left(1\otimes \left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}\right)$$

\noindent By Proposition \ref{psiofbp}, we have that 

$$\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^L\right) = \left(\left(\Phi_B^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p = \left(\left(\Phi_B^L\otimes I_p\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)$$

\noindent So returning to the right hand side of (\ref{eqn1MainPf}) we get
\begin{align*}
\pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\left(\psi\left(\phi_{B^{(p)}}\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)\right)\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^L\right)\right)
    & = \pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\left(\left(1\otimes \left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}\right)\left(\left(\Phi_B^L\otimes I_p\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\right)\\
    & = \pi\left(\left(\Delta(B)\otimes I_p\right)\delta\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)\right)
\end{align*}


So it suffices to find an augmentation $\delta$ such that the right hand side is equal to $\Delta(B^{(p)}B')$.  If $w(B)$ is even, then we simply let $\delta = \epsilon_p$.  Since $w(B)$ is even we know that $w(B^{(p)})$ is also even and that $\Delta(B) = I_k$.  Since $\epsilon_p\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right) = \Delta(B')$, it follows that the right hand side is equal to $\Delta(B^{(p)}B')$.

Now suppose that $w(B)$ is odd.  In a moment we will define $g\colon \{1,\ldots,p\}\rightarrow \{\pm 1\}$ for each of the cases for when $p$ is even or odd, but for now let $\delta(a_{ij}) = g(i)g(j)e_k(a_{ij})$.  Fix $i,j$ and consider a monomial $M$ in $\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}$.  Since $B'$ is a braid on $p$ strands included into $B_{pk}$, if $i>p$ or $j>p$ then $M$ is 0 or 1 and $\delta(M) = M$.  If $i,j\le p$, such a monomial must arise from a product in the algebra of paths in $D$ \todo[color=\ltblue]{just introducing this notation} that begins at $i' = \perm(B')(i)$ and ends at $j$, so $M=c_{ij}a_{i',j_1}a_{j_1,j_2}\ldots a_{j_m,j}$ for some $j_1,\ldots j_m\in \{1,\ldots,p\}$, unless $i' = j$, in which case it is possible that $M=c_{ij}$.  We then see that 

$$\delta(M) = g(i')g(j)\left(\prod_{k=1}^m g(j_k)^2\right)\epsilon_p(M) = g(i')g(j)\epsilon_p(M)$$

\noindent Or $\delta(M) = M = g(i')g(j)\epsilon_p(M)$ in the case that $i'=j$ and $M=c_{ij}$.  Since this is true for each monomial $M$ chosen in $\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}$, we have that

$$\delta\left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}\right) = g(i')g(j)\epsilon_p\left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}\right)$$

Now let $x_1 = 1$, and $x_l = \perm(B')(x_{l-1})$ for $1<l\le p$.  Since the first $p$ strands of $B'$ close to a knot, $\perm(B')$ is given by the $p$-cycle $(x_1x_2\ldots x_p)$.

Suppose $p$ is even.  Then we let $g(x_1) = 1$, and $g(x_l) = -g(x_{l-1})$ for $1<l\le p$.  Since $p$ is even, $w(B^{(p)})$ is even and therefore the opposite parity of $w(B)$.  Our definition of $g$ gives that $\delta\left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ii}\right) = -\epsilon\left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ii}\right)$ for $i\le p$, so 

$$\delta\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right) = 
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
(-1)^{w(B')+1} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -I_{p-1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & I_{(k-1)p} \end{array} \right)
$$
\noindent and therefore
$$
\pi\left(\left(\Delta(B)\otimes I_p\right)\delta\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)\right) = \diag[(-1)^{w(B) + w(B') + 1},1\ldots 1] = \Delta(B^{(p)}B')
$$
\noindent as desired.

Next suppose that $p$ is odd.  Then we let $g(x_1) = g(x_2) = 1$ and $g(x_l) = -g(x_{l-1})$ for $2<l\le p$.  Since $p$ is odd, $w(B^{(p)})$ is odd and therefore the same parity of $w(B)$.  Our definition of $g$ gives that $\delta\left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{11}\right) = \epsilon\left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{11}\right)$ and $\delta\left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ii}\right) = -\epsilon\left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ii}\right)$ for $1<i\le p$, so 

$$\delta\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right) = 
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
(-1)^{w(B')} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -I_{p-1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & I_{(k-1)p} \end{array} \right)
$$
\noindent and therefore
$$
\pi\left(\left(\Delta(B)\otimes I_p\right)\delta\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)\right)= \diag[(-1)^{w(B) + w(B')},1\ldots 1] = \Delta(B^{(p)}B')
$$
\noindent as desired.  Similarly, we have that
$$
\pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\circ\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}B'}^R\right) = \pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\left(\left(\left(\Phi_B^R\otimes I_p\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\left(1\otimes \left(\Phi_{B'}^R\right)_{ij}\right)\right)
$$
but since $\epsilon_k\left(\Phi_B^L\right) = \epsilon_k\left(\Phi_B^R\right)$ and $\epsilon_p\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right) = \epsilon_p\left(\Phi_{B'}^R\right)$, in each case above we have
\begin{align*}
\pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\left(\left(\left(\Phi_B^R\otimes I_p\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\left(1\otimes \left(\Phi_{B'}^R\right)_{ij}\right)\right) &= \pi\circ(\epsilon_k\otimes\delta)\left(\left(\left(\Phi_B^L\otimes I_p\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\left(1\otimes \left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}\right)\right)\\
&= \Delta\left(B^{(p)}B'\right)
\end{align*}
Which completes the proof.
\end{proof}


\noindent We will use the following two lemmas in our proof of Proposition \ref{psiofbp}.


\begin{lem}\label{commutes}
$\psi(\phi_{\SpPm_n}(a_{ij})) = (\phi_{\s_n^{\pm 1}} \otimes \id)(\psi(a_{ij}))$ for all $1\le n < k$, $1 \le i,j \le pk$.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}\label{basecase}
$\psi\left(\Phi_{\SpPm_n}^L\right) = \left(\left(\Phi_{\s_n^{\pm 1}}^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p$
\end{lem}



%Proof of psiofbp
\begin{proof} [Proof of Proposition \ref{psiofbp}]
Let $B = \s_{n_1}^{q_1}\cdots\s_{n_r}^{q_r}$, where $1\le n_i<k$ and $q_i = \pm 1$.  We will prove the proposition by inducting on $r$.  The base case is already taken care of by Lemma \ref{basecase}.  Suppose that the proposition holds for braids of length $r-1$.  Let $B' =\s_{n_1}^{q_1}\cdots\s_{n_{r-1}}^{q_{r-1}}$ Then by the Chain Rule and Lemmas \ref{commutes} and \ref{basecase}, we have that
\begin{align*}
\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^L\right) &= \psi\left(\phi_{B'^{(p)}}\left(\Phi_{\Sigma^{q_r(p)}_{n_r}}^L\right)\cdot\Phi_{B'^{(p)}}^L\right)\\
&= \left(\phi_{B'}\otimes\id\right)\left(\psi\left(\Phi_{\Sigma^{q_r(p)}_{n_r}}^L\right)\right)\cdot \left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p\\
&= \left(\phi_{B'}\otimes\id\right)\left(\left(\left(\Phi_{\s_{n_r}^{q_r}}^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p\right)\cdot \left(\left(\Phi_{B'}^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p\\
&= \left(\left(\Phi_{B}^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p
\end{align*}
Which implies that $\psi\left(\Phi_{B^{(p)}}^R\right) = \left(\left(\Phi_{B}^R\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p$ as well, since $\Phi_B^R = \overline{\Phi_B^L}^t$ and $\psi(\overline{a_{ij}}) = \overline{\psi(a_{ij})}$.

%proof of commutes
\begin{proof} [Proof of Lemma \ref{commutes}]
Note that if $\psi(\phi_{\Sp_n}(a_{ij})) = (\phi_{\s_n} \otimes \id)(\psi(a_{ij}))$, then
$$\left(\phi_{\s_n}\otimes\id\right)\left(\psi\left(\phi_{\SpM_n}\left(a_{ij}\right)\right)\right) = \psi(a_{ij})$$
So $\psi\circ\phi_{\SpM_n}$ is the inverse function of $\left(\phi_{\s_n}\otimes\id\right)$, and therefore
$$\psi\left(\phi_{\SpM_n}\left(a_{ij}\right)\right) = \left(\phi_{\s_n^{-1}}\otimes\id\right)(a_{ij})$$

Furthermore, $\phi_B(\overline{a_{ij}}) = \overline{\phi_B(a_{ij})}$\todo[color=\ltblue]{does this need justification?} and $\psi(\overline{a_{ij}}) = \overline{\psi(a_{ij})}$, so it suffices to prove the lemma for $\Sp_n$ in the case where $i<j$.

With these restrictions, we then break the statement up into the cases from Lemma \ref{Sigma_n}, from which the first four cases as well as the last case can be checked easily.  Consider the sixth case.  Lemma \ref{Sigma_n} gives that
$$\psi\left(\phi_{\Sp_n}(a_{ij})\right) = \sum_{Y\subseteq \{np-p+1,\ldots,np\}}(-1)^{|Y|}\psi\left(a_{iy_1}a_{y_1y_2}\cdots a_{y_k,j+p}\right)$$
%&= \psi\left(A(i,j+p,\{np-p+1,\ldots,np\})\right)\\


Let $\a_i  = np-p+r_i$.  Note that if $y_1<\a_i$ then $\psi(a_{iy_1}) = 0$, and if $y_k>\a_j$ then $\psi(a_{y_kj}) = 0$, so the sum on the right hand side can be taken over $Y\subseteq\{\a_i,\a_i+1,\ldots,\a_j\}$.  Then we manipulate the sum to get\todo[color=\ltblue]{do I need to explain what I'm doing here?}

\begin{align*}
& \sum_{Y\subseteq \{\a_i,\ldots,\a_j\}}(-1)^{|Y|}\psi\left(a_{iy_1}a_{y_1y_2}\cdots a_{y_k,j+p}\right)\\
&= \psi\left(a_{i,j+p} - a_{i,\a_i}a_{\a_i,j+p}\right)\\
& \;\;\;\;+ \sum_{y=\a_i+1}^{\a_j}\sum_{Y\subseteq \{y+1,\ldots,\a_j\}}(-1)^{|Y|+1}\psi\left(a_{iy}a_{yy_1}\cdots a_{y_k,j+p}\right) + (-1)^{|Y|}\psi\left(a_{i,\a_i}a_{\a_i,y}a_{yy_1}\cdots a_{y_k,j+p}\right)\\
&= \psi\left(a_{i,j+p} - a_{i\a_i}a_{\a_i,j+p}\right)\\
& \;\;\;\;+ \sum_{y=\a_i+1}^{\a_j}\sum_{Y\subseteq \{y+1,\ldots,\a_j\}}(-1)^{|Y|}\psi\left(a_{i,\a_i}a_{\a_i,y} - a_{iy}\right)\psi\left(a_{yy_1}\cdots a_{y_k,j+p}\right)\\
\end{align*}



Note that $r_i = r_{\a_i}$ and since we're in the sixth case we have $(n-1)p<j\le np$, so $q_{\a_i}=q_y$.  Thus $\psi(a_{i,\a_i}) = a_{q_i+1,q_{\a_i}+1}\otimes 1 = a_{q_i+1,q_y+1}\otimes 1$ and $\psi(a_{\a_i,y}) = 1\otimes a_{r_{\a_i},r_y} = 1\otimes a_{r_i,r_y}$, so we have
$$\psi(a_{i,\a_i}a_{\a_i,y} - a_{iy}) = \left(a_{q_i+1,q_y+1}\otimes 1\right)\left(1\otimes a_{r_i,r_y}\right) - a_{q_i+1,q_y+1}\otimes a_{r_i,r_y} = 0$$
Thus the right hand side reduces to 
$$\psi\left(a_{i,j+p} - a_{i\a_i}a_{\a_i,j+p}\right)$$

\begin{rem}
The fact that $\psi(a_{i,\a_i}a_{\a_i,y} - a_{iy}) = 0$ and $\psi$ behaves similarly for the analogous terms in the other cases is the key to this proof working, and $\psi$ is defined the way it is mainly so that this will be true.  As we hinted at earlier, the homomorphism $\rho\colon \A_{pk}\rightarrow \A_k$ defined to send $a_{ij}$ to $a_{q_i+1,q_j+1}$ if $r_i=r_j$ and to 0 otherwise would also send these terms to 0, so Proposition \ref{psiofbp} would still be true with $\rho$ used in the place of $\psi$.  We will need $\psi$ for the proof of the main result, however.
\end{rem}

\noindent Note that, since we're in the sixth case, $q_j + 1 = n$.  If $r_i = r_j$, then 
$$\psi\left(a_{i,j+p} - a_{i\a_i}a_{\a_i,j+p}\right) = \left(a_{q_i+1,n+1} - a_{q_i+1,n}a_{n,n+1}\right)\otimes 1 = (\phi_{\s_n} \otimes \id)(\psi(a_{ij}))$$
If $r_i < r_j$, then
\begin{align*}
\psi\left(a_{i,j+p} - a_{i\a_i}a_{\a_i,j+p}\right) &= \left(a_{q_i+1,n+1}\otimes a_{r_ir_j} - a_{q_i+1,n}a_{n,n+1}\otimes a_{r_ir_j}\right)\\
&= \left(a_{q_i+1,n+1} - a_{q_i+1,n}a_{n,n+1}\right)\otimes a_{r_ir_j}\\
&= (\phi_{\s_n} \otimes \id)(\psi(a_{ij}))
\end{align*}
Finally, if $r_i > r_j$, then
$$\psi\left(a_{i,j+p} - a_{i\a_i}a_{\a_i,j+p}\right) = 0 = (\phi_{\s_n} \otimes \id)(\psi(a_{ij}))$$

The proof for the seventh case goes exactly as the proof for the sixth case except with all $i$'s replaced with $i+p$, all $(j+p)$'s replaced with $j$, all $y_i$'s replaced with $y_{k+1-i}$, and with $\a_i$ and $\a_j$ swapped.  The proof for the fifth case goes exactly as the proof for the seventh, except that $j-p$ is removed from the set that $Y$ is a subset of in all the sums.\todo[color=\ltblue]{check this}
\end{proof}



%proof of basecase
\begin{proof} [Proof of Lemma \ref{basecase}]\todo[color=\ltblue]{check}
First we will prove the lemma for $\Sp_n$.  We can extend the definition of $\psi$ to be from the free module over $\A_{pk}$ generated by $\{a_{i*}|1\le i\le pk\}$ to the free module over $\A_{k}\otimes \A_{p}$ generated by $\{a_{i*}|1\le i\le k\}$ by defining $\psi(a_{i*}) = a_{i*}$ and extending by linearity.  Then the statement of the lemma is equivalent to saying that for all $1\le i\le pk$, the coefficient of $a_{j*}$ in $\psi\left(\phi_{\Sp_n}(a_{i*})\right)$ is equal to 0 unless $r_j = r_i$, in which case it is equal to the coefficient of $a_{q_j*}$ in $\phi_{\s_n}(a_{q_i*})$.  If $q_i + 1 \ne n$, this fact can be easily checked.  In the case that $q_i + 1 = n$, we have that
$$\psi\left(\phi_{\Sp_n}(a_{i*})\right) = \psi\left(A(i+p,*,\{np-p+1,\ldots,np\}\right)$$
\noindent which is equal to
$$\psi(a_{i+p,*} - a_{i+p,\a_i}a_{\a_i,*}) = a_{i+p,*} - (a_{q_i,q_i+1}\otimes 1)a_{\a_i,*}$$
by the same argument that was used in Lemma \ref{commutes}.  The coefficients of the $a_{j*}$ are equal to the coefficients of the $a_{q_j*}$ in $\phi_{\s_n}(a_{q_i*})$, so we have $\psi\left(\Phi_{\Sp_n}^L\right) = \left(\left(\Phi_{\s_n}^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p$.

Using this fact, the Chain Rule, and Lemma \ref{commutes}, we have
\begin{align*}
\left(\left(I_{pk}\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right) &= \psi\left(\Phi_{\Sp_n\SpM_n}^L\right)\\
&= \psi\left(\phi_{\SpM_n}\left(\Phi_{\Sp_n}^L\right)\right)\psi\left(\Phi_{\SpM_n}^L\right)\\
&= \left(\phi_{\s_n^{-1}}\otimes \id\right)\left(\left(\left(\Phi_{\s_n}\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p\right)\psi\left(\Phi_{\SpM_n}^L\right)\\
\end{align*}
But note that the Chain Rule also gives that $\left(\left(\Phi_{\s_n^{-1}}^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p$ is the inverse of $\left(\phi_{\s_n^{-1}}\otimes \id\right)\left(\left(\left(\Phi_{\s_n}\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p\right)$, so 
$$\psi\left(\Phi_{\SpM_n}^L\right) = \left(\left(\Phi_{\s_n^{-1}}^L\right)_{ij}\otimes 1\right)\otimes I_p$$
\noindent which completes the proof.
\end{proof}



\begin{proof} [Proof of Lemma \ref{Sigma_n}]\todo[color=\ltblue,inline]{add other cases}
The first four cases as well as the eighth can be easily checked.  We will prove the remaining cases by induction on $l$.  Consider the sixth case.  The base case is covered by (\ref{tau}).  For the inductive step, we have that

\begin{align*}
\phi_{\k_{m,l}}(a_{ij}) &= \phi_{\t_{m,p}}\left(\phi_{\k_{m+1,l-1}}(a_{ij})\right)\\
%&= \phi_{\t_{m,p}}\left(A(i-l+1,j,X_{m+1,l-1})\right)\\
&= \sum_{Y\subseteq \{m+p+1,\ldots,m+l+p-1\}} (-1)^{|Y|} \phi_{\t_{m,p}}\left(a_{i-l+1,y_1}a_{y_1y_2}\cdots a_{y_k,j}\right)\\
&= \sum_{Y\subseteq \{m+p+1,\ldots,m+l+p-1\}} (-1)^{|Y|} \left(a_{i-l,y_1}-a_{i-l,m+p}a_{m+p,y_1}\right)a_{y_1y_2}\cdots a_{y_k,j}\\
&= \sum_{Y\subseteq \{m+p,\ldots,m+l+p-1\}} (-1)^{|Y|} a_{i-l,y_1}a_{y_1y_2}\cdots a_{y_k,j}\\
&= A(i-l,j,X_{m,l})
\end{align*}\todo[color=\ltblue]{is this clear/can it be shortened?}
